General:

    1. Fix rotation bug (see comments in src/testing.R).

    2. Rescale custom stat/sym assessments to [0, 1] properly.

    3. Produce comprehensive data file rather than printing results.

    4. Change statistic-based test to compare from opposite
       or random bins rather than from left to right.

    5. Add Boston housing data from UCI ML repository.

    6. Consider using dynamic discretization for bin count determination.
       Consider Sturge's method, Scott's method, and
       Freedman/Diaconis's method (see Margaritis, 2005).

    7. Handling unconditioned vs. conditioned data?

Add existing algorithms from literature:

    1. Margaritis/Thrun method.
       (a) To read: Dirichlet priors.

    2. Sun & White's method.

    3. Zhang's method.
       (a) To read: vector spaces, nonlinear transformations.
       (b) To read: tensors.
       (c) To read: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Other questions:

    1. Formula expressions for custom assessments.

    2. Ring, four-cloud plots: will these be encountered in practice?
       (If not, symmetry test is just as valuable in practical terms.)
