Software:

    1. New parameter: percentage of "micro" tests to pass/fail
       for "macro" test to pass/fail.

    2. Ability to force observaton of param.disc_bins.

    3. Create reporting mode which saves verbose output in
       addition to generating images of discretized graphs.

    4. Change statistic-based test to compare from opposite
       margins rather than from left-to-right.

Other:

    1. Ring, four-cloud plots: will these be encountered in practice?
       (If not, symmetry test is just as valuable in practical terms.)

    2. Write out statistical algorithm.
