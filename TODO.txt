General:

    1. Scale stat/sym assessments to [0, 1].

    2. Produce comprehensive data file rather than printing results.

    3. Add Boston housing data from UCI ML repository.

    4. Consider using dynamic discretization for bin count determination.
       Consider Sturge's method, Scott's method, and
       Freedman/Diaconis's method (see Margaritis, 2005).

    5. Handling unconditioned vs. conditioned data?

Add existing algorithms from literature:

    1. Margaritis/Thrun method.

    2. Sun & White's method.

    3. Zhang's method.
       (a) To read: tensors.
       (b) To read: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
       (c) To read: kernel methods.
