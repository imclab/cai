Unconditional comparisons:

    1. Refactor similar custom assessments (remove duplicated code).

    2. Add Boston housing data from UCI ML repository.

    3. Consider using dynamic discretization for bin count determination.
       Consider Sturge's method, Scott's method, and
       Freedman/Diaconis's method (see Margaritis, 2005).

    X. Scale stat/sym assessments to [0, 1].
       (a) Generate and tag variations (SD, etc.) of Biogelot graphs.
       (b) ROC/DET curve after tagged (ind/dep) data sets in place.

Conditional comparisons:

    TODO after unconditional stuff complete.

Add existing algorithms from literature:

    1. Margaritis/Thrun method.

    2. Sun & White's method.

    3. Zhang's method.
       (a) To read: tensors.
       (b) To read: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
       (c) To read: kernel methods.

Other questions:

    1. Formula expressions for custom assessments.
