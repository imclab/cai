General:

    0. Fix bug with sym_custom assessment: score > 1

    1. Produce comprehensive data file rather than printing results.

    2. Change statistic-based test to compare from opposite
       or random bins rather than from left to right.

    3. Start using dynamic discretization bin count determination.
        Consider Sturge's method, Scott's method, and
        Freedman/Diaconis's method (see Margaritis, 2005).

    4. Add Boston housing data from UCI ML repository.

    5. Add rank-correlation assessments.

    6. Dynamic loading of new assessments and generators.

    7. Handling unconditioned vs. conditioned data?

Add existing algorithms from literature:

    1. Margaritis/Thrun method.
       (a) To read: Dirichlet priors.

    2. Zhang's method.
       (a) To read: vector spaces, nonlinear transformations.
       (b) To read: tensors.
       (c) To read: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Other questions:

    1. Ring, four-cloud plots: will these be encountered in practice?
       (If not, symmetry test is just as valuable in practical terms.)

    2. Concise representation of "stat" assessment algorithm.
